# Student-Portal-Grade-Calculator

ProjectSuccess was a group project (of 3 people) for our Software Architectures class. ProjectSuccess is a system that will help you see the great progress you are making throughout your school semester. Our system shall have three main components, the student section, the teacher section, and the grade calculator section. In the student section (Student Portal), a student will be able to input all of their assignment grades that will be displayed on the home page. The student portal represents what the student can do within our system. It focuses on the studentâ€™s ability to add a grade, with additional features such as getting an assignment due date from the Teacher Portal and calculating their grade from the Grade Calculator. 

This project was built using the SpringBoot framework while using HTML for web development.
